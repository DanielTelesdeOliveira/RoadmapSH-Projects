            <h2 id="library-project">Community Library System </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the current situation in Brazil, marked by a reduced number of libraries and,
                    consequently, limited access to books, my group and I developed a prototype of a
                    library management system for the Computer Science and Society course.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project aims to improve and simplify the management of these environments,
                    especially community libraries.
                </p>

                <h3>Technologies</h3>
                <p>
                    The project was mainly developed using Java, due to its robustness, along with the
                    Spring Boot framework, with the goal of learning the tool and developing a web
                    application—an area we had little prior experience with at the time.
                </p>

                <p>    
                    In addition, MySQL was used as the database management system for local storage and
                    data queries.

            <h2 id="compiler-project">Compiler for a custom Language</h2>
            <p>
                During the Compiler course, I have the opportunity to develop a compiler for a new 
                programming language created by my group and me.
            </p>

            <p>
                The compiler covers the lexical and syntactic analysis phases. The parser was
                implemented using the recursive descent technique, along with formal grammatical
                structures to recognize and validate the language syntax.
            </p>

            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                This project was implemented in Java, following the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.
            </p>

            <p>Below is an image representing its structure.</p>

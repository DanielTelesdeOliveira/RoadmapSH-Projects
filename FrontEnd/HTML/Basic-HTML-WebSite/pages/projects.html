        <h2 id="library">Community Library System </h2>
        <p>
            Due to the current situation in Brazil, marked by a reduced number of libraries and,
            consequently, limited access to books, my group and I developed a prototype of a
            library management system for the Computer Science and Society course.
        </p>

        <p>
             The project aims to improve and simplify the management of these environments,
            especially community libraries.
        </p>

        <h3>Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            The project was mainly developed using Java, due to its robustness, along with the
            Spring Boot framework, with the goal of learning the tool and developing a web
            application—an area we had little prior experience with at the time.
        </p>

        <p>    
            In addition, MySQL was used as the database management system for local storage and
            data queries.
        </p>

        <h2 id="compiler">Compiler for a custom Language</h2>
        <p>
            During the Compiler course, I have the opportunity to develop a compiler for a new 
            programming language created by my group and me.
        </p>

        <p>
            The compiler covers the lexical and syntactic analysis phases. The parser was
            implemented using the recursive descent technique, along with formal grammatical
            structures to recognize and validate the language syntax.
        </p>

        <p>Below is an image representing its structure.</p>

        <h3>Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            This project was implemented in Java, following the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.
